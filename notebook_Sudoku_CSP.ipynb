    "# Sudoku Solver Using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)\n",

    "## What is CSP?\n",
    "A Constraint Satisfaction Problem is a mathematical problem where we must assign values to a set of variables in such a way that the constraints between them are satisfied. Sudoku is a classic example of a CSP, where each cell is a variable and the constraints are the rules of the game (each row, column, and 3x3 box must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition).\n",
